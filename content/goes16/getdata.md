### Best Effort
The data are being made available on a best effort basis by all parties involved. There are no guarantees the data will be available when you really need it.

### File Formats
The data is being made available in a NetCDF file format. The data are referenced in an angular system (x & y coordinates measure radians).

### Products Available & Name Conventions

There are several Level 1b (L1b) and Level 2 (L2) ABI products available over different regions with different scanning times. The table below summarizes the products, the refresh rate for the products and gives example paths of where to find the data.

The ABI sensor images over 16 different channels (wavelengths) as described in the table below

| Channel | Central Wave Length (Âµm) | Sprectrum Name |
| :----:  | :---------: | :------------: |
| 1       |  0.47  |   Visible - Blue |
| 2       |  0.64  | Visible - Red |
| 3       |  0.86  | Near IR - Vegetation |
| 4       |  1.37  | Near IR - Cirrus |
| 5       |  1.6  | Near IR - Snow/Ice |
| 6       |  2.2  | Near IR - Cloud Ice |

The filenames are

    <sensor>-<level>-<product short name>/<year>/<julian day>/<hour>/OR_<sensor>-<level>-<product short name>-M<scanning mode>-C<channel>-G<GOES Satellite>-s<start time>_e<end time>_c<central time>.nc

### Data Access

Data access is provided via a S3-API compatible service. The files may be downloaded with the aws cli, boto, or through a web browser.

[https://osdc.rcc.uchicago.edu/noaa-goes16](https://osdc.rcc.uchicago.edu/noaa-goes16)

This endpoint is S3-api compatible, so when you visit in your browser it will return XML with a truncated list of files available to download.

We recommend using the [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or the [python boto library](https://github.com/boto/boto) to access the data. An example awscli command to list the contents of the bucket would look like:
```
aws s3 ls s3://noaa-goes16/ --no-sign-request --endpoint-url https://osdc.rcc.uchicago.edu --no-verify-ssl
```

The current plan is to store a rolling 100 TB archive of GOES-16 data. At present data volumes we expect this to be an about 8 month rolling archive.

This dataset is being generously hosted by The Research Computing Center (RCC) at the University of Chicago.

The [Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/), within the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research. Innovation, and National Laboratories, was created in early 2010 to provide the University of Chicago community a full-service high-performance computing (HPC) resources, including one of the top 500 HPC cluster, high-speed parallel storage, 3D HD visualization facilities, ready-to-use applications, domain computational scientists, and data-management strategies to researchers and students across all departments and divisions of the University. 

### Archive: 2017 Major Hurricanes

To facilitate ease of use for the research community an archive of the available GOES 16 data surrounding the 2017 Hurricane season is available on OSDC Griffin.   The available data products for all date ranges for the 2017 >= Category 4 Hurricanes (Maria, Irma, Jose) are available at: 

[https://griffin-objstore.opensciencedatacloud.org/noaa-goes16-hurricane-archive-2017/](https://griffin-objstore.opensciencedatacloud.org/noaa-goes16-hurricane-archive-2017/)

```
irma_range = [242, 259] #Formed: August 30, 2017; Dissipated: September 16, 2017
maria_range = [259, 276] #Formed: September 16, 2017; Dissipated: October 3, 2017
jose_range = [248, 269] #Formed: September 5, 2017; Dissipated: September 26, 2017
```

A sample command for pulling the L1b-RadC product for day 1 of Hurricane Irma from OSDC using awscli:   

```
aws s3 cp s3://noaa-goes16-hurricane-archive-2017/ABI-L1b-RadC/242/. [mylocaldir] --endpoint-url https://griffin-objstore.opensciencedatacloud.org --recursive
```

Please note that OSDC Griffin currently only handles awsv2 signatures, so it may be necessary to manage an environment for transfer where awscli or botocore <= version 1.09.  

For more information on pulling data from OSDC Griffin, or sample functions that can aid pulling multiple products for multiple days, review the notebook at: https://github.com/wwells/data-transfer/blob/master/HurricaneTransfer.ipynb
